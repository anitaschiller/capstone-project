# capstone-project

This is the repository for my capstone-project of neue fische's Web Development Bootcamp.

reMEMBER is a web app that serves users who meet a lot of new people (e.g. at a conference) as a memory aid: 
Simply upload contact data, enter notes on individual meetings and highlight important information with a click. This way, you always have an overview of what was discussed and are optimally prepared for the next zoom call.
