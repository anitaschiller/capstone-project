# capstone-project/reMEMEMBER app

This is the repository for my capstone-project at neue fische's Web Development Bootcamp.

## About reMEMBER
reMEMBER is a web app that serves users who meet a lot of new people (e.g. at a conference) as a memory aid: 
Simply upload contact data, enter notes on individual meetings and highlight important information with a click. This way, you always have an overview of what was discussed and are optimally prepared for the next zoom call.

## Technical highlights
React / React-Router / React-Styleguidist / Styled-Components / PropTypes / LocalStorage / Node.js / MongoDB  / mongoose / Express / Cypress / Adobe XD
